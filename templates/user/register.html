          The CSRF package includes tools that help you implement checking against
          cross-site request forgery (“csrf”). Due to the large number of variations
          on approaches people take to CSRF (and the fact that many make compromises)
          the base implementation allows you to plug in a number of CSRF validation
          approaches.CSRF implementations are made by subclassing CSRF.For utility,
          we have provided one possible CSRF implementation in the package that can
          be used with many frameworks for session-based hash secure keying,
          SessionCSRF.
          
          Most CSRF implementations hinge around creating a special token,
          which is put in a hidden field on the form named csrf_token,
          which must be rendered in your template to be passed from the browser
          back to your view. There are many different methods of generating
          this token, but they are usually the result of a cryptographic hash
          function against some data which would be hard to forge.
